## Introduction
The 2030 Agenda acknowledges that eradicating poverty in all its forms and dimensions, including extreme poverty, is the greatest global challenge and an indispensable requirement for sustainable development. 

The first Sustainable Development Goal aims to “End poverty in all its forms everywhere”. Its seven associated targets aims, among others, to eradicate extreme poverty for all people everywhere, reduce at least by half the proportion of men, women and children of all ages living in poverty, and implement nationally appropriate social protection systems and measures for all, including floors, and by 2030 achieve substantial coverage of the poor and the vulnerable.

As recalled by the foreword of the 2015 Millennium Development Goals Report, at the Millennium Summit in September 2000, 189 countries unanimously adopted the Millennium Declaration, pledging to “spare no effort to free our fellow men, women and children from the abject and dehumanizing conditions of extreme poverty”. This commitment was translated into an inspiring framework of eight goals and, then, into wide-ranging practical steps that have enabled people across the world to improve their lives and their future prospects. The MDGs helped to lift more than one billion people out of extreme poverty, to make inroads against hunger, to enable more girls to attend school than ever before and to protect our planet.

Nevertheless, in spite of all the remarkable gains, inequalities have persisted and progress has been uneven. Therefore, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its set of Sustainable Development Goals have been committed, as stated in the Declaration of the Agenda, “to build upon the achievements of the Millennium Development Goals and seek to address their unfinished business”.

The theme of the 2017 High-Level Political Forum was "Eradicating poverty and promoting prosperity in a changing world”", and it included SDG 1 as one of the focus SDGs.

## Problem Statement

### Significance of the Proposed Project
This project will provide a variety of data sets exemplifying poverty in the Philippines. This research will be useful for the following purposes:

To the **Students** who will be needing data that may be found from the project. This will allow them to have a thorough understanding of the Philippines' poverty throughout time.

To the **Teachers** who will be teaching about poverty in the Philippines through the years. The information collected in the project can be utilized in their courses.

To the **Government Officials** who will be needing data that they may use for their future project/s related to poverty. 

To the **Future Researchers** to provide background knowledge concerning poverty in the Philippines. This project's analytics can provide them with new insights, suggestions, and conclusions.
